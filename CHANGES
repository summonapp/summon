1. Have the home page empty
    -Add a section for the events you have planned vs. the events you are attending

2. For create event have the fields be:
    Tite
    Description
    When
    Where
    Anything Else?
    
    confirm, createEvent, event [TAKEN CARE OF]

3. After you click confirm, and you have the event code, and you click on 'View Event'
   what gets displayed is only the first word of the string. For example, Shazzy Birthday for
   the event title, only shows 'Shazzy' [TAKEN CARE OF]
   
4. If you plan the event, you should have an option to accept or reject, because then it
put its as an event you are attending [TAKEN CARE OF]

5. Maybe on the homepage for events they are attending, they can have an accept section
and a reject section. maybe a pending option if they dont click either button?
    [TAKEN CARE OF]

6. Should we remove the option where we show who is attending? Users wanted that feature
but then we would need a login option/include facebook option [TAKEN CARE OF]

7. Back button re-submits form

8. Page reloads before javascript executes ("You attended yay!" or "You declined. Boo!")

9. Status is not too visible ("you are attending", "you rejected", "pending")

10. Javascript
