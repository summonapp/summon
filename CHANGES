Sign Up link needs to be more prominent in the sign in page

The word "or" in the sign in page is not properly centered

The top navigation banner changes size between main page and everything else

Make font bigger




Taylor's comments
hard to read the black writing in signin page
pop up a calendar to choose date of event, for date and time
spread out the buttons in confirm button
home button
back button
wrong event code error checking
clicking/slide down javascript annoying, want to view multiple things at once
